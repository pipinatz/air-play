            'description' => '<div><strong>Keanu Reeves</strong> rarely talks about money. I scoured the internet trolling through many interviews and videos of him trying to find a comment from him about money.</div><div><br></div><div>Why? He has famously given away much of his money to an unnamed Leukemia Foundation and the cast and crew of movies he has appeared in without keeping a lot for himself to buy nice stuff or flaunt his success.</div><div><br>One of the most successful Hollywood actors of all-time doesn’t focus on money. There has to be something in that. There has to be a reason.</div><div><br>Finally, after hours of searching, <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/keanu-reeves-money-is-meaningless-57159431/">an interview with Keanu back in 2006</a> shared his views on money:<br><br><br></div><h1>Money adds stress</h1><div><br>“Building your bank account,” as Keanu puts it, is stressful.</div><div><br>You constantly have to haggle to make money, work at it, maximize every opportunity, be greedy at times, and make your objective be to make a dollar.</div><div><br>All of that is stressful. The more stuff you own, the more time and attention it requires. Having everything is having peace of mind and that comes from having less. When you don’t have stuff to worry about, you can use your talent to help others the way Keanu has throughout his acting career.<br><br></div><h1>When your financial wealth thrives, another area of your life suffers</h1><div><br>This is the nature of life. When you’re doing well in one area of your life, like your finances, another area is suffering. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrOb2YgRb6c">In Lorraine Kelly’s 2008 interview with Keanu,</a> he says “My private life is a boring disaster, but work is good.”</div><div><br>Even one of the most successful actors on the planet has an area of his life that is a disaster. We all do.</div><div><br>A guy I met off LinkedIn who is a lawyer explained to me one lunchtime that he makes millions of dollars from his career and is unhappy. His wife is annoyed with him and his kids never see him. This is another classic example of how money can be a distraction from the things that matter.</div><div><br>An obsession with money has its downsides. Learn how to cap the downsides of money through Keanu.</div><div><br></div><h1>Money is a by-product</h1><div>I have said many times in various blog posts and in a book I’m writing right now on mastering blogging that your job is to be useful and that is done by teaching, entertaining, inspiring, informing, or simply making people laugh.</div><div><br>Choosing one of these goals as your focus will produce more money than you could ever expect. Focusing on money as your primary driver has the opposite effect.<br><br><br></div><h1>Let money help you live simply</h1><div>One of the modern-day curses is decision fatigue. There are so many decisions you can make and each one drains your energy. Money multiples the number of decisions you need to make.</div><div><br>The solution is to automate your decisions and you can be inspired by how Keanu has done this.</div><div><br>He doesn’t do social media.</div><div><br>He doesn’t attend A-List celebrity parties.</div><div><br>He doesn’t own lots of houses.</div><div><br>He consciously chooses to ride the subway.</div><div><br>He chooses to have an adventure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV_7ZDJJGXY">when his flight makes an emergency landing</a> rather than order a limo and leave the economy passengers on their own.</div><div><br>Simplicity is massively underrated when it comes to money. If you have money or acquire money unexpectedly, use it to live simply like Keanu.<br><br><br></div><h1>Rather than focus on money, live generously</h1><div>This is exactly what Keanu teaches us through his actions, not what he says. You live generously not just by using any money you make for good, but by being generous with your time.</div><div><br>If you watch every interaction with Keanu and his fans on Youtube or Instagram, you’ll see that he’s generous with his time. The greatest gift he can give them is his time and attention. You have the same opportunity to live generously.</div>',

            'description' => '<div>To be in the top 10% requires you to behave like the top 10%. Do things that set you apart.</div><div><br>Now, I’m nowhere near the top 10% nor will I tell you about billionaires’ routines.</div><div><br>But I’m going to tell you how I protect my focus so I can live a wholesome life. I don’t wake up at 5 am or go for a run, but I have completely turned around my reality in the past year.</div><div><br>From feeling like a complete misfit in my 9–5 with soul-sucking work, I finally do what I love for a living. And the writer’s path and treating me super well.</div><div><br>But the key change is — I’m energised, motivated, and aligned with my purpose.</div><div><br>Here’s what helped me get here.<br><br><br></div><h1>1. Don’t Kill Your Neurons</h1><div><br>Has the red notification number ever seduced you to click, scroll, and react?</div><div><br>I was cribbing yesterday in a call about how I clicked on my LinkedIn notification button after months. It agitated me so badly.</div><div><br>A year and a half ago, I stopped checking notifications on certain apps and instead blocked time to engage and respond there on my own.</div><div><br>Brain drain with notifications today is inevitable, but at least we can pick and choose our brain drain.</div><div><strong><br>To do</strong></div><div><br>Find out which notifications you really need to see (for me, that’s iMessage only) and mute everything else. On social networks, choose platforms where you absolutely <em>do not</em> need to see any notifications and never click on them.</div><div><br>Notifications fight for your attention and time. Don’t give them that power.</div><h1>2. Refreshing Isn’t So Refreshing</h1><div><br>If you’re a creator online, then chances are you check stats.</div><div><br>But here’s a little secret — refreshing stats don’t make them go up, only doing the work does.</div><div><br>It’s addictive to keep seeing stats of views, sales, money, etc. It’s better to shift your focus to your process of doing the work instead of refreshing stats in anticipation.</div><div><strong><br>To do</strong></div><div><br>Analyse and learn from your stats, but don’t depend on your dopamine on them.</div><h1>3. Detach From Work</h1><div><br>Let me tell you something that’ll harm my career if I ever apply for a job again — I never really cared about work. I wasn’t so passionate about my job that I’d work late nights and weekends on it as my colleagues did.</div><div><br>Once, my boss offered to help me over the weekend with a presentation. I should’ve said yes because it’d help me set a good impression. But I didn’t.</div><div><br>Practising this while doing your own work is difficult because it\'s like your baby.</div><div><br>For your own sanity, please detach from your work. Once you hit publish or finish a presentation or whatever you do for a living, forget about it and move on.</div><div><strong><br>To do</strong></div><div><br>Detach from work so you can focus on ‘the work’ and not results or what people are saying about it.</div><h1>4. Energy Vampires Are Real</h1><div><br>Once you do well (or at least plan to), you’d realise how few people around you want you to be extraordinary.</div><div><br>Some people will subtly talk down on you in the name of banter to cover up their meanness. Others will suck up to you.</div><div><br>These are your <a href="https://medium.com/publishous/energy-vampires-people-who-are-holding-you-back-from-acing-life-b8fb4d573112">energy vampires</a>. They’ll bring you down by seeping in a bit of their negativity into you.</div><div><br>After my surgery that left me in bed for 6 weeks, <a href="https://medium.com/wholistique/why-im-going-to-stop-rekindling-friendships-ee01f5765e38">I clearly segmented friends</a> into those who care and those who don’t. People 5 minutes away from my house didn’t care about me and school friends who I don’t speak to often checked up on me every day.</div><div><br>This showed me who my genuine friends were.</div><div><strong><br>To do</strong></div><div><br>Be very, very careful of who you surround yourself with.</div><div><br>Only keep good mates around.</div><h1>5. No Instagram</h1><div><br>You do not need to see hundreds of pictures every day of memes or people [pretending to] live their best lives.</div><div><br>Instagram subconsciously makes you feel</div><ul><li>less pretty</li><li>less rich</li><li>more inadequate</li></ul><div><strong><br>To do</strong></div><div><br>You cannot have big ideas if you’re subconsciously feeling negative about your entire life.</div><div><br>Either go cold turkey on it or do it like me — I download it once in 2 to 4 weeks for under 30 minutes.</div><div><br>Highly encourage going cold turkey on it for a bit. I did it for 7 months and it helped me level up my self-awareness and self-esteem.</div><h1>6. Curate Your Feed</h1><blockquote><br>“It’s not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.” — <a href="https://sourcesofinsight.com/focus-quotes/">Bruce Lee</a></blockquote><div><br>What you see is what you think about. What you think about becomes dominant in your head. Your dominant thoughts become your reality.</div><div><br>So why do you want to think about shit? Putting in shit doesn’t bring out any rainbows.</div><div><br>Scrolling is inevitable, but what you scroll about is. Everybody told me Twitter is toxic, but I curated my feed by muting everyone who talks about politics and all topics I’m not interested in.</div><div><br>Now my feed is full of positivity, creator economy, writing, mindsets, wealth, etc.</div><div><strong><br>To do</strong></div><div><br>Only take in the good stuff because you can.</div><div><br>Curate your online feed. Block or mute what doesn’t serve you.</div><div><br>Be extremely possessive about what you consume.</div><h1>7. Tracking Work Time</h1><div><br>If you don’t work a 9–5, you’d want to use free software like Clockify to track your time.</div><div><br>You’d be surprised how much your time goes into meaningless things in the name of work. This is the reason so many people don’t pursue hobbies, workout, or take out time to read in the name of:</div><blockquote><em><br>“I don’t have time.”</em></blockquote><div><br>This helped me realise I want to <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/freelancing-makes-me-dislike-writing-a32c62ed20d6?sk=2479401ed075dc3d0822622178a19f1c">cut down on freelancing</a> because the time-to-money ratio was the lowest here.</div><div><strong><br>To do</strong></div><div><br>Track your time so you can manage and own it better.<br><br><br>I often come out as a weirdo to do these things. But if being weird helps me build my life and create a business, I have no regrets.</div><div><br>All these are techniques to reduce external noise so your mind can make less clutter inside.</div><div><br>You cannot execute big ideas with a monkey mind that cannot sit down and focus.</div><div><br>Protect your focus and energy so you can direct it to fulfil your dreams.</div>',

            'description' => '<div>Your 20s are full of uncertainty.</div><div><br>This uncertainty makes them difficult. I wish someone had given me a handbook to deal with my 20s, because mine almost <a href="https://medium.com/the-ascent/the-torture-that-took-me-26-years-to-heal-from-34ccae68b2a5">ruined me</a>.</div><div><br>As a 36 year old, here are a few solid lessons that can rescue your 20s.<br><br><br></div><h1>Don’t fall for the corporate promises</h1><div>Entering the workforce in your 20s make you a prime candidate for <a href="https://timdenning.com/9-5-employees-keep-telling-themselves-the-lie-one-more-year/">brainwashing</a>. Corporations get off on this. Why?</div><div><br>It’s how they make profit using your youth.</div><div><br>Don’t fall for it. Most businesses couldn’t give a fudge about you. If you got hit by a car tomorrow they’d have another 20-something in your seat within 2 weeks. Also, the career growth they promise is a nothingburger.</div><div><br>No one can promise you a promotion or a raise.</div><div><br>That comes down to how good you are at making friends with people in the right places. That’s right, the best career paths don’t come from working hard or the skills you have. They come from who you know.</div><div><br>I got a job in banking doing a dream job most people would trade their mother-in-law for to get. Not because I know jack about banking. But because I ran into a farmer in a lift and said “Gday mate, how’s your day?”</div><div><br>Corporations tell pretty fairytales that are bullsh*t.</div><div><br>Use a job to learn. Then quit so you can go earn the real big bucks.<br><br></div><h1>Better to marry right than marry a monster</h1><div>Bigfoot was nearly my wife.</div><div><br>She showed no emotion towards me. I have no idea how we ever dated for so long. I guess I was desperate and dealing with mental health issues. Any hole seemed like a goal at the time.</div><div><br>Then I nearly married her out of fear. No one wants to be alone forever, no matter how many singles books we read telling us “you’re better off.”</div><div><br>We crave company.</div><div><br>Be diligent with <a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/i-got-married-finally-5c4c5658b95b">who you marry</a>. A great test is to take multiple overseas holidays in busy countries. If you can make it through without ripping each other’s hair out, then it’s a good sign.</div><div><br>Just don’t rush into it. Marriage is best left to when you’re ready. 30s are often a better time. That way you’ve collected more data on your potential partner. It’s not a decision you want to screw up.</div><div><br>50% of everything you’ve ever earned walks out the door if it ends in divorce.</div><div><br>Slow and steady. And if you’re being rushed it’s a huge, red, blinking siren.<br><br></div><h1>“The most interesting people are paradoxes”</h1><div>Interesting people are everywhere. Spark up random conversations. Get to know people without ever talking too much about yourself. Look for the people who make the trends look ridiculous.</div><div><br>When you find a few good ones, keep in contact with them. Call them every now and then and have them as your mentors.</div><div><br>But never use the label “mentor.” People hate that. It feels like an unpaid job.<br><br><br></div><h1>Stop measuring where you are compared to others</h1><div>I spent my 20s <a href="https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-i-completely-changed-my-career-using-linkedin-e711122d6151">scrolling LinkedIn</a> and looking at people’s career progressions.</div><div><br>If my job title was “associate” and they were the same age or younger and had the title “manager,” I got pissed.</div><div><em><br>You’re falling behind in life</em> I’d say to myself in between sips of Carlton Draught beer.</div><div><br>Don’t worry about how far people have come. Most of our googleable successes are a lie anyway. People have a habit of exaggerating their accomplishments to look good.</div><div><strong><br>Remember</strong>: what comes up when people google your name is a resume. Smart people know that so they write everything as if their future employer is reading.</div><div><br>What looks like the dream life is a mirage.</div><div><br>A big fancy job on Wall Street looks like a dream. The cars, the sexy dates, the money, the houses. Yet talk to people who have what you think you want.</div><div><br>You’ll find most of them are miserable deep inside. They’ve got all the material results but they’re dead inside because of the <a href="https://medium.com/p-s-i-love-you/30-years-of-no-meaning-in-life-changed-in-one-day-60bafdb1b0ab">absence of meaning</a>. Your results are right where they should be.</div><div><br>Slow down to speed up.<br><br><br></div><h1>Practice deep focus</h1><div>The work that makes you come alive happens when you’re not distracted.</div><div><br>We’re drowning in technology. In your 20s it’s cool to be plugged into all the latest apps and have your phone everywhere you go with wireless headphones connected to drown out the boomers.</div><div><br>Without focus though, you’ll never achieve your ambitious goals. Focus amplifies input so your output looks effortless. If you really want to master focus then google “<a href="https://medium.com/the-ascent/3-hours-of-creative-flow-every-day-is-all-you-need-to-change-your-life-4afa8df5eec">flow states</a>.”</div><div><br>They turn your focus into a superpower so time is better used. That’s how you get more time to do what you love doing.<br><br><br></div><h1>Shut the hell up and do the work</h1><div>There’s a lot of “I don’t know” in your 20s. Good. You’re not supposed to know too much. We’re all just making stuff up as we go anyway.</div><div><br>Quit complaining. Quit blaming. Quit trying to plan everything.</div><div><br>Just do the work. Ryan Holiday <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/35-lessons-35-years-old/">says</a> when he writes a book he has no clue how it’s going to work out. All he does is follow his process of creating notecards, and the book somehow ends up finished.</div><div><br>The process creates the progress.</div><div><br>Nothing is easy. But what you look back and love in your 30s are the things you busted your ass for in your 20s.<br><br><br></div><h1>Invest like a mofo</h1><div>If you buy stocks/crypto in your 20s they can grow to become enormous in your 30s. Learn how money works. Learn investing. Set up auto-transfers from every paycheck you earn to flow into investments.</div><div><br>Automated investing makes your 30s a dream.<br><br><br></div><h1>Make bad travel decisions on purpose</h1><div>Jack Raines is a 20-something weirdo. Yet he can teach us a lot.</div><div><br>He makes bad travel decisions on purpose. He’ll interrupt a great career to leave the country and backpack. He’ll interrupt his investments to fund his travel and go to Vegas.</div><div><br>Contrary to popular belief, your 20s are supposed to be wild and unpredictable. Otherwise, what stories are you going to tell the next generation when you’re old and grey?</div><div><br>Travel is a great way to learn faster. Different cultures teach you different <a href="https://medium.com/the-ascent/13-ways-i-completely-changed-my-life-in-a-year-and-so-can-you-2223a8da63c3">life lessons</a> you can apply when you return home.</div><div><br>The worst thing you can do is live in the same place forever. When your surroundings change you see things you didn’t see before. Suddenly a water fountain looks cool when back home you’d walk past it and not even notice.</div><div><br>Let your brain jump on planes.</div>',

If I want a specific result, I must make time for the required action.</div><div><br>The good news is, you don’t need to lose weight, eat healthily, exercise more, start a business, write, meditate, or do anything else that sounds <em>cool.</em></div><div><br>But if you want to do any of that, you’ll need to do it regardless of your excuses.</div><div><br>I promise you’ll always find reasons for <em>not</em> doing hard things.</div><div><br>But I can also promise that those excuses will eventually lead to frustration and anger.</div><div><br>You might have a lot on your plate and be busy as hell.

At school, I found most other girls annoying and mostly hung up with guys.</div><div><br>When I decided to build my own business instead of pursuing a traditional career, I had to change my social circle again.</div><div><br>Back then, most of my friends had no idea what they wanted to do in life, while I had a sharp vision and was spending every evening, weekend, and holiday working my dreams.</div><div><br>Even with my family, I used to feel like the outsider who was just <em>different</em> because I fundamentally disagreed with so many things they did and said.</div><div><br>Over the last two years, I’ve learned that I’m not alone in thinking I’m <em>weird.</em></div><div><br>Through honest, open, and vulnerable conversations with other women, I found out that my feelings were not just valid but <em>common.</em></div><div><br>Most people constantly hide their different sides because they’re afraid of being judged for who they really are.</div><div><br>And that’s why you think others are <em>“normal”</em> while you aren’t.</div><div><br>Yet, the truth is, most people you know think that way too. They also believe they’re <em>weird</em>.</div><div><br>And in the end, what does <em>“normal”</em> mean anyway?!</div><div><br>We’re all unique in our own ways, and that’s what makes each of us a masterpiece.</div><div><br>Instead of trying to “fit in,” we should maybe just allow ourselves to <em>stand out</em> by showing who we really are.<br><br><br></div><h1>I’ll do it later/tomorrow/next week.</h1><div>Well, you probably won’t. And you know it.</div><div><br>If something sucks today, it’ll likely suck tomorrow too. But tomorrow will be better if you just get the job done <em>now.</em></div><div><br>When planning the future, we often think <em>we’ll have more time.</em></div><div><em><br>“I’m so busy today. I’ll just do this next week!”</em></div><div><br>But the truth is, when the future arrives, we’re still busy. And the main problem is, by procrastinating and delaying important tasks, we usually ruin our ability to focus. That’s because we <em>keep thinking </em>about what we need to do, even if we don’t actively do it.<br><br><br></div><h1>If I had more [fill the gap], I’d finally be happy!</h1><div>The truth is, you wouldn’t.</div><div><br>Even though external factors can shape our emotional wellbeing, they’re mostly a reflection of what’s going on inside our heads and hearts.</div><div><br>More money wouldn’t make you any happier, just like a different job or a different partner wouldn’t magically change how you feel.</div><div><br>If you feel frustrated, angry, or even just a little stuck, you must first look <em>inside </em>before blaming anything on the outside.</div><div><br>Saying that having <em>this</em> or <em>that</em> would make us happier is easy because it helps us shuffle off responsibility: “<em>I’d be happy if I had more money. I don’t have it right now, so I’m allowed to be unhappy.”</em></div><div><br>If you want to feel differently, you mostly need to <em>do things differently.</em></div><div><br>If money is the main problem, you can start to <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/6-harsh-truths-about-money-you-dont-want-to-hear-6d3195cd6a18">change how you <em>think</em>&nbsp;about money</a>, track your income and expenses so you can potentially save more, or start a side job or business to increase your income.</div><div><br>These are just three of many more potential solutions, and the truth is, <strong>most problems are solvable.</strong></div><div><br>The main challenge is that whining and complaining are much more comfortable than taking responsibility and fighting for change.</div>',

But money in and of itself isn’t <a href="https://medium.com/curious/wealth-is-quiet-rich-is-loud-poor-is-flashy-3879614cd459">true wealth</a>.</div><div><br>Wealth equals meaningful relationships with others. Wealth equals youth or at least a body that’s free from major health issues. Wealth is wisdom you stack high through life experiences and people you learn from.</div><div><br>Wealth is a <a href="https://medium.com/curious/people-who-brag-about-being-in-back-to-back-meetings-deeply-misunderstand-productivity-ed00701d3f69">blank calendar</a>. Wealth is zero Zoom calls. Wealth is free time to explore your creativity and imagination.

Any one of us can lose our jobs during these tough times. And when everyone is looking for a job at the same time it’s bloody hard to get one. That’s what extreme risk looks like.</div><div><em><br>Business</em> is just a fancy word that gets taken out of context.</div><div><br>All of us are business owners. The entity that is you connects to the internet each day and makes money doing something.</div><div><br>The subtle difference between a job and seeing yourself as a business is:</div><ul><li>With a job, most of the value goes to someone else</li><li>With a business, you keep most of the value</li></ul><div><br>Why do we give up our value and let an employer have most of it? We’re scared. We’re afraid of risk. If you can get past these limiting beliefs you can unlock a level of abundance most can only dream of. How?</div><div><br>Start a business as a <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/here-are-some-side-hustle-ideas-i-strongly-recommend-you-avoid-e2991caa4a8e">side hustle</a>.</div><div><br>If it doesn’t work then there’s zero risk. You still got your job. If the business does work then you can slowly transition from a full-time job, to a part-time job, to no job.</div><div><br>And if you go all-in on a business and it fails, no problemo. You can always get another job.</div><div><br>Career risk only exists if you <strong><em>don’t</em></strong> see your life as a series of small bets.<br><br><br></div><h1>Lie #3 — You need a mentor to get rich</h1><div>I get asked to be a mentor all the time. It’s called unpaid coaching.</div><div><br>When I pull apart why someone wants a mentor there’s this belief that some knight in shining armor riding a rainbow unicorn is going to save them from whatever deep crap they’ve found themselves in.</div><div><br>It ain’t going to happen.</div><div><br>Mentors don’t make you rich. Mentors don’t give you money or help you figure out the hard stuff. Nope.</div><div><br>The people who make a lot of money figure stuff out through experience. Sure they have people that help. But rarely does an unpaid <a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/9-quotes-by-tony-robbins-that-will-help-rewire-your-brain-9220e03bca87">Tony Robbins</a> make it all happen for them with zero stress.</div><div><br>That’s a fantasy.</div><div><br>And financial fantasies can cause you to waste your entire life waiting for a miracle that whatever god you believe in will never deliver.</div><div><br>Making money comes down to personal responsibility. Own it.<br><br><br></div><h1>Lie #4 — Rich dad poor dad is a good teacher</h1><div>I get told by people on Twitter to read this god-forsaken book all the time.</div><div><br>Sure, it was a nice read back in the day. But have you seen how Robert Kiyosaki (the author) has aged? Terribly. Let’s not forget he was in business with that Donald Duck president too.</div><div><br>(Read the deep dives I did on him <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/were-not-getting-financially-smarter-by-reading-rich-dad-poor-dad-728c6c62fc4a">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/the-post-grad-survival-guide/robert-kiyosaki-acts-like-my-poor-dad-not-my-rich-dad-de4d9c46a68b">here</a>.)</div><div><br>One video I watched of Mr Rich Dad was about how he believes America will collapse. He said he bought lots of guns and bullets. He said in this future world we live in, bullets will be like currency.</div><div><em><br>We’ll buy stuff with these bullets.</em></div><div><br>Then he went on to say he went to a meeting to do a business deal. He took duffel bags full of bullets to the restaurant where they ate lunch. The waiter who served their food saw the half-open bags full of bullets and asked them to leave. Seriously.</div><div><br>Bullets for currency.</div><div><br>What a crackpot. Don’t take money advice from crazies. It’s not the end of America. It’s business as usual.<br><br><br></div><h1>Lie #5 — You can’t make money writing online</h1><div>I hear this one plenty. I call bullsh*t.</div><div><br>You can. I’m proof. So are the other 50 writers I spend time with in a group chat who do it too.</div><div><br>Money can be made doing anything. The trick with <a href="https://medium.com/writing-cooperative/today-i-celebrate-8-years-of-writing-online-heres-what-i-ve-learned-9627c7e2f60e">writing online</a> is to not be so damn selfish. Less ads. Less referral links. Less affiliate codes. Less stories about yourself. Less tangents. Less talk of followers and comparing stats.</div><div><br>More writing. More usefulness. More practicality. More humility. More emotion. More vulnerability.</div><div><br>You make money online as a writer when you build an email list. Most writers are terrible at that. They rely on Mark Zuckerburger’s algorithms to make their dreams come true.</div><div><br>The Newsbreak-style charity payments are a short-term gift.</div><div><br>Don’t rely on them. Here’s the strategy to steal: 1) Write 2) Learn about readers’ problems 3) Solve their problems with an offer you email them. That’s how you make real money online as a writer.<br><br><br></div><h1>Lie #6 — Save up for what you want</h1><div>Saving is bad. Inflation eats away at the money you put in the bank.</div><div><br>The system wants you to save so it can tax you with inflation — currently <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi">8.6%</a> in the US.</div><div><br>But if there’s stuff you want to buy — like a home — there’s a better way than saving…</div><div><br>Make more money.</div><div><br>How? Stack <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/my-unsexy-income-streams-are-low-key-easy-to-recreate-2e2bedeedb6b">income streams</a>. One income stream only gets you so far. If you’re connected to the internet you can make wifi money.</div><div><br>Sure, it may not be a million dollars. But each income stream adds up. What do you sell online? The same skills you sell to your employer. If those skills have enough value to earn a salary, they have enough value to earn money online.</div><div><br>Then with the extra income streams you can choose to buy hard assets — gold, stocks, real estate, Bitcoin/Ethereum.</div><div><br>Over time the stuff you want will get cheaper with more income streams. Once your needs are met, it’s time to meet the needs of people who live in 3rd world countries without internet.</div><div><br>Making money is a mindset.

            'description' => '<div>As a psychologist, I spend a lot of time talking to people who struggle with low self-esteem. They say things like:</div><ul><li><em>I’m very successful, but it never feels like enough.</em></li><li><em>I know this is bad to say, but I just never feel worthy.</em></li></ul><div><br>But whatever the original cause of your low self-esteem, here’s what you need to understand about it:<br><br><br></div><h1>1. Spend More Time with People You Actually Enjoy</h1><div>This is often interpreted in terms of success, productivity, and ambition: If you hang around with lazy, unmotivated people, it’s going to rub off on you negatively.</div><div><br>What people miss about this quote is that it applies to more than just success and achievement…</div><div><strong><br>The people you consistently spend time with affect your wellbeing and self-esteem too.</strong></div><div><br>If you constantly hang around people who don’t particularly like you, that’s gonna rub off and it’s going to be harder to like yourself more. On the other hand, if you spend a lot of time with people who genuinely like you and enjoy spending time with you, it’s going to be much easier to like yourself more.</div><div><br>On one level this seems obvious: Spend more time with people you actually enjoy! But this can be a surprisingly hard thing to do because competing desires often interfere.</div><div><br>For example, while many people like the idea of hanging around people they genuinely <em>enjoy,</em> they also like the idea of hanging around people who will advance their social standing. And more often than not, the second desire outcompetes the first:</div><ul><li>Instead of going to dinner and a movie with your easy-going buddy from high-school, you commit to attending a dinner party with a co-worker who could put in a good word for you with the partners at the firm.</li><li>Instead of joining that Tuesday evening mystery novel book club you’ve been so excited about, you commit to attending Tuesday night PTAs, a group you don’t mind but also don’t particularly jibe with.</li></ul><div><br>If you find yourself chronically spending time with people you don’t really enjoy, take a moment to consider why that is. <em>What’s motivating you to do this? Social pressure? Ambition? Fear?</em></div><div><br>Then, try experimenting in very small ways with spending more time with people you truly enjoy: <em>Email your fellow PTAers letting them know you won’t be able to make it this week and get coffee with your best friend instead. Text an old buddy and grab lunch with them instead of a coworker.</em></div><div><strong><br>Spend a little more time with people you enjoy and who enjoy you back and you just might start to enjoy yourself.<br><br></strong><br></div><h1>2. Practice Gentle Self-Talk</h1><div>I think all of us have people in our lives who are critical, negative, and at times, just plain mean:</div><ul><li>Maybe it’s your manager at work who’s always criticizing your performance and comparing you to other coworkers.</li><li>Or maybe it’s a spouse who’s perpetually sarcastic and judgmental about everything from your wardrobe choices to your parenting style.</li></ul><div><br>If you have one or two of these people in your life, you know how draining and difficult it is just being around them. It’s as if they suck the life and energy right out of your soul, leaving you stressed, depressed, and empty.</div><div><strong><br>Ironically, we dislike it when other people are mean to us, but we’re incredible mean to ourselves!</strong></div><div><br>And the main way we’re mean to ourselves… negative self-talk.</div><div><br>If you struggle with low self-esteem, there’s a good chance your inner voice is a jerk. It’s harsh, judgmental, overly-critical, pessimistic, and sometimes downright cruel:</div><ul><li>You flub the last slide in your presentation at work and instantly your inner voice jumps on you: <em>I’m such an idiot! I always screw something up. I knew I shouldn’t have agreed to lead the presentation for the team.</em></li><li>You forget to give your kid a kiss when you drop her off at school and as you’re pulling out of the parking lot, your inner voice starts berating you: <em>Oh my God, I didn’t even give her a kiss goodbye. She’s going to be so upset… I’m probably the only mom at school who forgets to give their kid a kiss goodbye. Maybe I really am just a bad mom?</em></li></ul><div><br>Now, here’s the thing you really need to understand about your overly-<a href="https://nickwignall.com/negative-self-talk/">negative self-talk</a>: Even if you understand intellectually that it’s not accurate or helpful to talk that way to yourself, you’re still going to feel miserable if you keep doing it.</div><div><br>Self-talk is a behavior. It’s something we <em>do</em>. And sometimes, it’s something we do so often that it becomes a habit.</div><div><strong><br>If you’re constantly cruel to yourself, you’re going to feel the same as if another person was constantly cruel to you.</strong></div><div><br>The best way to undo a habit of overly negative self-talk is to focus on one simple idea: <em>gentleness</em></div><div><br>Try to catch yourself speaking harshly or critically to yourself and ask: <em>Is there a gentler way of talking to myself?</em></div><ul><li>Instead of: <em>I’m such an idiot!</em> Try: <em>Well, I did screw that that last section of the presentation up, but overall it went pretty well.</em></li><li>Instead of: <em>Why am I always so lazy?!</em> Try: <em>I wonder if there’s a different strategy I could use to workout more consistently?</em></li></ul><div><br>You wouldn’t be friends with someone who was constantly putting you down, so it shouldn’t be a surprise that you don’t like yourself very much when you’re constantly putting yourself down.<br><br><br></div><h1>3. Clarify Your Values</h1><div>Ultimately, healthy self-esteem comes from living your life in a way that aligns with your values.</div><div><br>On the other hand, if you habitually compromise on your values in the way you think and act, you’re setting yourself up for low self-esteem.</div><div><br>For example:</div><ul><li>Have you made a plan to work out at the gym more regularly? Every time you follow through on that goal, you’re training your own brain to believe that you are trustworthy and reliable, the kind of person who does what they say they will.</li><li>But every time you forget or decide to stay on the couch watching Netflix after a long day of work, you’re teaching your brain that you’re not trustworthy and reliable, that you don’t really care about what you claim to care about. This is a recipe for low self-esteem.</li></ul><div><br>Of course, following through on our best intentions and commitments to ourselves isn’t easy. And one of the biggest reasons people struggle to do it is because their values aren’t clear and compelling.</div><div><strong><br>Having clear values means you have a well-defined vision for the things that matter most to you.</strong></div><div><br>The term <em>values</em> includes everything from traditional virtues like honesty and integrity all the way down to more mundane but still important commitments like maintaining your physical health through exercise or spending quality time with good friends.</div><div><br>Here’s the catch, though:</div><div><strong><br>When your values are unclear, there’re not very motivating.</strong></div><div><br>On the other hand, the more clear, specific, and compelling our values are, the more drawn to them we are, like gravity. And when our values exert more pull on us, it becomes easier to act in a way that lines up with them, which then generates high self-esteem.</div><div><br>Of course clarifying your values isn’t something you just do once and then are done with… Clarifying your values means <a href="https://nickwignall.com/know-your-values/">building a habit of reflecting on them regularly</a>.</div><div><br>Once you know your values and begin aligning your thoughts and actions with them, healthy self-esteem will not be far behind.<br><br><br></div><h1>4. Keep Your Promises to Yourself</h1><div>People with low self-esteem are usually really good at keeping their promises to other people and really bad at keeping promises to themselves.</div><div><br>They’re so concerned with other people’s wants and needs that they end up constantly compromising what <em>they</em> want. And when this compromise becomes a habit, their self-esteem takes a serious hit.<br><br>Well, what do you think happens to your relationship with yourself when you ignore your own suggestions and desires, disregard your own recommendations and commitments, and flake out on the plans you make for yourself?</div><div><strong><br>Yeah, you start to think pretty poorly of yourself!</strong></div><div><br>You lose respect for yourself, and eventually, just plain don’t like yourself.</div><div><br>Of course, a part of healthy self-esteem does come from doing good for other people. It’d be hard to have genuine high self-esteem if you were a jerk to everyone in your life!</div><div><br>But the mistake most people with low self-esteem make is to assume that taking care of other people’s wants and desires is all they need for self-esteem:</div><ul><li>They choose a prestigious career path because society (or their parents) admire it.</li><li>They choose to marry someone because they know their family would approve.</li><li>They take on too much responsibility at work because they want to be a good employee and impress their boss.</li></ul><div><br>But take it from me — a psychologist who talks to unhappy people every day — putting other people: when you prioritize other people’s wants and needs to the exclusion of your own, unhappiness and low self-esteem are sure to follow.</div><div><br>On the other hand…</div><div><strong><br>True self-esteem comes from balancing the wants and needs of others with the wants and needs of yourself.</strong></div><div><br>If you don’t have a solid foundation of keeping promises to yourself, all the noble self-sacrifice in the world won’t make you like yourself more.</div><div><br>Addressing your own wants and needs doesn’t mean you’re selfish or a narcissist or an ego-maniac. It’s just basic psychology: In order to feel good about yourself <em>and</em> be helpful to others, you have to make sure you’re putting fuel in your own tank. And one of the best ways to do that is to keep your promises to yourself.</div>',
